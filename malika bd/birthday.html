Your smile lights up the softest night,A moon that turns the dark to light. Your voice a melody so true, Every note a piece of you. 19th of October 2005 is the date that the most amazing, loving, and gorgeous woman was born. The day God blessed our world with her presence. It is that day that the world started having colors, colors brighter than sunsets, warmer than sunlight, and softer than moonlight. Because that was the day you, Malika, came into this world. And even though I wasn’t there to witness it, I thank God every single day that He brought you into existence. You are a gift not only to the world but especially to me. Your smile could stop time itself… your laugh has a way of making even the darkest days feel light. Every word you say, every look in your eyes, every heartbeat of yours is something I want to cherish forever. Malika, loving you is the most beautiful thing my heart has ever known. You’ve become my home, my safe place, my everything. On this special day, I don’t just celebrate your birthday I celebrate you. Your soul. Your kindness. Your beauty. Your heart. I promise to love you more with each passing day. To stand beside you in every chapter of life. To hold you close when the world feels heavy and to celebrate you every time you shine because you always do. Happy Birthday, my love. Here’s to you my greatest blessing, my forever reason to smile.'
